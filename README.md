# Data Visualizations Showcase

This is a Showcase of all the different Data Viz projects I have created using
the D3.js library, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Projects will be displayed below with GIFs I made showcasing each one's
functionality.

However, each project can be demo-ed on your own PC by: 
1. Dowloading the corresponding project folder to your PC (ex: Marching Squares)
2. Opening the index.html file with Google Chrome or any 
   other popular browser by right clicking on it. 

## Marching Squares 

Marching Squares visualizes two-dimensional scalar fields through the use of contours.
In this case I used the Hurricane Isabel dataset, with Temperature and Pressure being the scalar fields.

Skills learned and practiced in this project:
1. Implementing the marching squares algorithm for extracting isocontours in a piecewise manner
2. Utilizing a case-table structure to maintain repeated computational structure and develop the algorithm in a compact way
3. d3.js library 
4. Experimenting with visual encoding of scalar fields utilizing both isocontour outlines and filled isocontours.

Example of a Case Table:
