# Data-Visualizations-Showcase

This is a Showcase of all the different Data Viz projects I have created using
the D3.js library, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

Projects will be displayed below with GIFs I made showcasing each one's
functionality.

However, each project can be demo-ed on your own PC by: 
1. Dowloading the corresponding project folder to your PC
2. Opening the index.html file with Google Chrome or any 
   other popular browser by right clicking on it.
